### 🎉 Event Guest List Manager

A simple, interactive web app to manage an event guest list using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This project helps you learn how to capture form input, dynamically update the DOM, and build a user friendly UI without page reloads.

### 🧠 Learning Goals
Build a functioning guest list application

Suppress default form behavior using event.preventDefault()

Manipulate the DOM with JavaScript

Practice event handling and user interaction

### 📋 Introduction
This project is a code challenge focused on DOM manipulation. You'll build an Event Guest List Manager that lets users:

Add guests to a list

Remove guests

Mark RSVP status

And more!

All interaction is handled dynamically — no page refresh required.

### ✅ Deliverables
As a user, you should be able to:

### 💡 Tips
Use event.preventDefault() to stop form submissions from reloading the page.

Use document.querySelector or getElementById to target elements.

Manipulate the DOM using appendChild, innerText, and other methods.

Attach event listeners to dynamically added elements.
